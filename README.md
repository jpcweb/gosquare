# gosquare
## A simple moving square (Basic) in Go v1.6 and SDL

Works on Mac OS X 10.11.4 and Ubuntu 15.10.
You have to install sdl2 on your system !

SDL2 on Ubuntu 15.10 :
Check on Google, it's simple!

SDL2 on Mac OS X:
I use macport (https://www.macports.org/)

1. Install Macport
2. Install XCode and Command line tool
3. Once you have both installed: **$ sudo port install libsdl2 libsdl2_ttf libsdl2_image**
4. Then you can run main.go
